# PART 2 — THE 6 REAL BUSINESS PROBLEMS

---

## PROBLEM 1 — Massive Customer Churn Crisis

### What the data shows:
| Segment | Customers | Churn Rate |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Champions | 141 | 0% |
| Loyal | 1,408 | 0% |
| At Risk | 672 | 0% (but about to churn) |
| Lost | 45,822 | **98.74%** |
| New Customers | 45,292 | **100%** |

- 90,535 out of 93,335 customers are High Risk
- Only 237 customers are Low Risk
- 49% of all customers are already Lost
- New customers (45,292) are churning at 100% — they buy once and never return

### Why this is happening:
- No retention strategy exists — customers buy once and disappear
- No loyalty program, no follow-up, no re-engagement campaign
- New customer acquisition is strong but retention is broken
- Average frequency of Lost customers = 1.01 (barely one order ever)

### Business Impact:
- Acquiring a new customer costs 5x more than retaining one
- Olist is spending on acquisition and getting zero repeat value
- Champions (141 customers) have CLV of R$2,174 vs Lost (R$174)
- That is 12.5x more value per loyal customer

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Email reactivation campaign for 672 At Risk customers
  → Offer 10–15% discount to bring them back before they go Lost
  → Priority: Do this first. These customers still have some loyalty.

ACTION 2: Onboarding sequence for New Customers
  → After first order: send thank you + recommendation email
  → Day 7: send related products based on first purchase
  → Day 30: send loyalty reward if they reorder

ACTION 3: Champions retention program
  → These 141 customers generate R$2,174 avg CLV
  → Give them VIP status, early access, exclusive offers
  → Losing even 20 champions = R$43,000 CLV lost

ACTION 4: Build subscription / loyalty model
  → Customers who subscribe (monthly box, etc.) have forced frequency
  → Converts one-time buyers into recurring revenue
```

## PROBLEM 2 — Heavy Dependence on São Paulo (SP)

### What the data shows:
| State | Revenue | % of Total |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| SP | R$6,041,602 | 37.5% |
| RJ | R$2,158,351 | 13.4% |
| MG | R$1,882,714 | 11.7% |
| ALL other 24 states | R$6,027,825 | 37.4% |

- SP alone = 37.5% of total revenue
- Top 3 states = 62.6% of revenue
- Bottom 5 states combined = R$132,508 (less than 1%)

### Why this is happening:
- Olist started in São Paulo — brand awareness is concentrated there
- Logistics infrastructure is stronger in SE Brazil
- Marketing spend is likely concentrated in SP/RJ/MG

### Business Impact:
- If SP has any economic shock, 37% of revenue is at risk
- Over-dependence on one region = business vulnerability
- Huge untapped market in the other 24 states

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Identify high-potential underperforming states
  → RS (R$903K), PR (R$809K) — already decent, can grow with marketing
  → SC, BA, GO — mid tier, good logistics, worth targeting

ACTION 2: Freight subsidy for expansion states
  → North/Northeast states have high freight ratio (0.20–0.22)
  → Subsidize freight for first 3 orders to acquire customers cheaply
  → Once habit is formed, remove subsidy gradually

ACTION 3: Regional seller recruitment
  → Recruit sellers from underserved states (AM, RO, AC, AP)
  → Local sellers = lower freight costs = better margins in those states

ACTION 4: Regional marketing campaigns
  → Target RS and PR first — lower freight ratio, good margins
  → These are the most profitable expansion opportunities
```

## PROBLEM 3 — Low Margin Categories Dragging Profitability

### What the data shows:
**Highest margin categories:**
| Category | Revenue | Margin |
|----------|---------|--------|
| moveis_decoracao | R$922K | 35.34% |
| utilidades_domesticas | R$798K | 35.09% |
| ferramentas_jardim | R$593K | 33.67% |
| cama_mesa_banho | R$1.29M | 33.28% |

**Lowest margin categories (problem areas):**
| Category | Revenue | Margin | Issue |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| pcs (computers) | R$248K | 23.34% | Too low — freight low but product margin thin |
| portateis_casa | R$50K | 24.39% | Very low margin |
| telefonia_fixa | R$60K | 26.07% | Declining product category |
| relogios_presentes | R$1.31M | 26.20% | **HIGH revenue but LOW margin — biggest risk** |

### The critical insight:
`relogios_presentes` (watches & gifts) is the 2nd highest revenue category
at R$1.31M but has only 26.20% margin — well below the 32.3% average.
This category is pulling down overall profitability significantly.

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Price optimization for relogios_presentes
  → It generates R$1.31M revenue — a 3% margin improvement = R$39,000 extra profit
  → Test 5–8% price increase on mid-range watches
  → Bundle watches with gifts to increase AOV and justify higher price

ACTION 2: Promote high-margin categories actively
  → moveis_decoracao (35.34%) and utilidades_domesticas (35.09%)
  → More marketing spend on these = same revenue, more profit
  → Feature them in homepage, email campaigns, promotions

ACTION 3: Review low-revenue + low-margin categories
  → telefonia_fixa (R$60K, 26% margin) — consider removing
  → portateis_casa (R$50K, 24% margin) — too small, too thin
  → These categories take operational effort for minimal return
```

## PROBLEM 4 — Revenue is Growing But Plateau is Starting

### What the data shows:
```
2017-01: R$136K   (start of growth)
2017-05: R$610K   (strong growth)
2017-11: R$1.19M  (peak — festive season)
2018-01: R$1.12M  (post-festive dip)
2018-03: R$1.17M  (recovery)
2018-04: R$1.17M  (flat — +0.26% MoM)
2018-05: R$1.17M  (flat — -0.06% MoM)
2018-06: R$1.06M  (declining — -9.18% MoM)
2018-07: R$1.06M  (flat — +0.01% MoM)
2018-08: R$1.02M  (declining — -4.07% MoM)
```

- Strong growth through 2017 (+107% MoM in Feb 2017)
- November 2017 = R$1.19M peak (Black Friday / festive season)
- From April 2018 onwards: 5 consecutive months of flat or negative growth
- Business has hit a growth ceiling

### Why this is happening:
- Customer base is not expanding (new customers churn immediately)
- No repeat purchases to sustain revenue base
- Seasonal spike (Nov 2017) not sustained — no loyalty mechanism
- Revenue is event-driven, not relationship-driven

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Convert Black Friday buyers into loyal customers
  → Nov 2017 spike = R$1.19M from one-time buyers
  → Follow-up campaign in Dec/Jan with personalized recommendations
  → Goal: convert even 10% of Nov buyers = 4,700 loyal customers

ACTION 2: Introduce subscription revenue
  → Monthly essentials box from top categories (cama_mesa_banho, beleza_saude)
  → Even R$99/month × 1,000 subscribers = R$1.19M/year guaranteed

ACTION 3: Upsell and cross-sell to existing customers
  → Champions (141 customers) buy 3.55 orders avg
  → Loyal (1,408 customers) buy 2.0 orders avg
  → Target these with higher-value product recommendations
  → Increasing their AOV by 10% = meaningful revenue without new customers
```

## PROBLEM 5 — High Late Delivery Rate in Key States

### What the data shows:
| State | Late Rate | Revenue |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| RJ | **13.97%** | R$2.15M |
| RR | 12.20% | R$9K |
| SP | 5.18% | R$6.04M |
| MG | 5.10% | R$1.88M |
| AM | 3.45% | R$28K |

- RJ has 13.97% late delivery rate — nearly 1 in 7 orders is late
- RJ is 2nd biggest state by revenue (R$2.15M)
- Late deliveries = bad reviews = lower ratings = fewer future orders

### Why this is happening:
- RJ has complex logistics (geography, traffic, multiple carriers)
- Possible carrier issues specific to Rio de Janeiro
- Sellers shipping from SP to RJ face longer transit times

### Business Impact:
- Late orders damage review scores
- Lower reviews = lower product ranking = fewer new orders
- RJ customers who get late orders have high churn probability

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Audit carriers serving RJ specifically
  → Identify which carriers cause most delays in RJ
  → Switch primary carrier or add backup carrier for RJ

ACTION 2: Set up local warehouse / fulfillment in RJ
  → Stock top 50 products in RJ fulfillment center
  → Reduces transit time from 3–5 days to 1–2 days

ACTION 3: Proactive communication for at-risk deliveries
  → If delivery is predicted late → send SMS/email to customer immediately
  → Offer small discount on next order as apology
  → This reduces negative reviews even when delivery is late
```

## PROBLEM 6 — Business Revenue Concentrated in Top 20% Products (80/20 Risk)

### What the data shows:
- 80/20 rule confirmed: top 20% of products generate ~80% of revenue
- Heavy concentration in beleza_saude and relogios_presentes
- If any top category faces supply issues or price competition → big revenue impact

### What to do:
```
ACTION 1: Diversify top product catalog
  → Actively recruit sellers in mid-tier categories
  → Goal: spread revenue across 10+ categories (currently 2–3 dominate)

ACTION 2: Protect top category supply chain
  → For beleza_saude (top revenue): have 3+ seller options per product
  → Single seller dependency = supply risk

ACTION 3: Grow second-tier categories
  → cool_stuff (R$719K, 29.47% margin) — potential to become top 5
  → automotivo (R$696K, 30.74% margin) — growing market in Brazil
  → Targeted seller recruitment + promotions in these categories
```

| Price optimization on relogios_presentes (+3% margin) | R$39K extra profit | Low |
| Onboarding email for all new customers | 5–10% conversion to repeat | Low |
| Reduce late deliveries in RJ | Protect R$2.15M revenue base | Medium |

### Level 2 — Medium Term (3–6 months)

| Action | Expected Impact | Effort |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Champions VIP program for 141 top customers | Protect R$306K CLV base | Medium |
| Expand marketing to RS and PR states | R$200K–400K new revenue | Medium |

| Action | Expected Impact | Effort |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Subscription / loyalty model | Predictable recurring revenue | High |
| Regional fulfillment center in RJ | Fix late delivery, protect R$2.15M | High |
| Diversify product categories | Reduce 80/20 concentration risk | High |
| Convert Black Friday spike to loyal base | Sustainable growth past plateau | High |

# PART 4 — GOLDEN ANSWER FRAMEWORK

## How to answer ANY business question in an interview

Use this structure for every answer:

```
1. BUSINESS CONTEXT    → What was the situation?
2. METRIC DEFINITION   → What did I measure and how?
3. ANALYSIS METHOD     → How did I find the insight?
4. INSIGHT FOUND       → What did the data actually show?
5. BUSINESS IMPACT     → What does this mean in money / risk?
6. RECOMMENDED ACTION  → What should the business do?
```

---

## Example — If interviewer asks: "What was your biggest finding?"

```
1. CONTEXT:
   Olist had strong revenue growth through 2017 but started plateauing in 2018.

2. METRIC:
   I tracked MoM growth rate and customer segment churn rates.

3. METHOD:
   RFM segmentation on 93,335 customers revealed segment health.
   Monthly trend analysis showed growth trajectory.

4. INSIGHT:
   97% of customers (90,535) are High Risk for churn.
   New customers (45,292) are churning at 100% — buying once, never returning.
   Revenue plateau from April 2018 is directly caused by zero retention.

5. IMPACT:
   Without retention fix, revenue will decline further as acquisition costs rise.
   Lost segment alone holds R$7.77M revenue but at 98.74% churn.
   Champions (141 customers) have 12.5x higher CLV than Lost customers.

6. ACTION:
   Priority 1 — Reactivate At Risk (672 customers) before they become Lost.
   Priority 2 — Build onboarding sequence for New Customers.
   Priority 3 — VIP program for Champions to protect highest CLV base.
```

---

## Example — If interviewer asks: "Where would you focus to increase revenue?"

```
1. The fastest revenue lever is retention, not acquisition.
2. Increasing repeat purchase rate from 1% to even 5% across 93K customers
   would add thousands of new orders at zero acquisition cost.
3. Second lever: margin improvement on relogios_presentes.
   R$1.31M category at only 26% margin — 3% improvement = R$39K pure profit.
4. Third lever: geographic expansion to RS and PR.
   Both states have strong margins (32%+) and existing customer bases.
   Low-cost expansion with high return potential.
