## 2. Data Engineering — Detailed Design

### 2.1 Table Join Design

All 9 tables are joined using these keys:

```
olist_orders
    |-- order_id ---------> olist_order_items
    |-- order_id ---------> olist_order_payments
    |-- order_id ---------> olist_order_reviews
    |-- customer_id ------> olist_customers
                                |
olist_order_items
    |-- product_id -------> olist_products
    |-- seller_id ---------> olist_sellers
                                |
olist_products
    |-- product_category_name -> product_category_name_translation

olist_customers / olist_sellers
    |-- zip_code_prefix --> olist_geolocation
```

Final result: 1 master dataframe with all columns from all 9 tables.

## 5. Machine Learning — Detailed Design

### 5.1 Problem Definition
```
Type    : Binary Classification
Target  : churned (1 = churned, 0 = active)
Definition of churn: customer with only 1 order (no repeat purchase)
```

### 5.2 Features Used
```
Feature           | Type    | Why It Matters
------------------|---------|----------------------------------
recency           | int     | How recently did they buy?
frequency         | int     | How often do they buy?
monetary          | float   | How much do they spend?
avg_profit        | float   | Are they profitable customers?
avg_freight       | float   | Do they buy heavy/expensive items?
avg_price         | float   | What price range do they buy?
total_items       | int     | How many items per order?
avg_installments  | float   | Do they pay in installments?
days_active       | int     | How long have they been a customer?
```

### 5.3 Model Designs

**Model 1 — Logistic Regression**
```
Type        : Linear binary classifier
How it works: Finds a line (decision boundary) to separate churned vs not
Good for    : Baseline comparison, highly interpretable
Weakness    : Cannot capture non-linear patterns
```

**Model 2 — Decision Tree**
```
Type        : Tree-based classifier
How it works: Splits data on feature thresholds (e.g. recency > 180?)
Good for    : Interpretable, shows decision rules clearly
Weakness    : Tends to overfit on training data
```

**Model 3 — Random Forest (SELECTED)**
```
Type        : Ensemble of many decision trees
How it works: Builds 100+ trees, each on random subset of data + features
              Final prediction = majority vote of all trees
Good for    : Handles non-linear patterns, resistant to overfitting
Why selected: Highest accuracy + best F1 score across all 3 models
Output      : churn_probability (0.0 to 1.0) per customer
```

### 5.4 Output Design

```
churn_probability >= 0.7  → churn_risk = "High Risk"
churn_probability 0.4–0.7 → churn_risk = "Medium Risk"
churn_probability < 0.4   → churn_risk = "Low Risk"
```

### 5.5 Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters Here |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy | % of correct predictions | Overall performance |
| Precision | Of predicted churners, how many actually churned | Avoid false alarms |
| Recall | Of actual churners, how many did we catch | Missing churners is costly |
| F1 Score | Balance of precision and recall | Best single metric for imbalanced data |
