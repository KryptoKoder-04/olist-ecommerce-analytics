## 1. What Is This Document?

HLD = High Level Design.
This document explains the BIG PICTURE of how the project works.
No code. No numbers. Just architecture — boxes and arrows.

Anyone reading this should understand:
- What the system does
- How data flows from raw files to final output
- Which tools are used at each stage and why

## 3. Data Flow — Step by Step

```
STEP 1: Raw CSV files arrive
        9 files, different shapes, different columns

STEP 2: Load into Pandas
        Each table becomes a DataFrame

STEP 3: Clean each table
        Fix dates → handle nulls → remove duplicates

STEP 4: Merge all 9 tables
        Join on: order_id, customer_id, product_id, seller_id
        Result: 1 big master dataframe (df.csv)

STEP 5: Feature engineering
        Create revenue, profit, margin, delay, RFM columns

STEP 6: Build summary tables
        Group by month / category / state / customer

STEP 7: Run analysis
        EDA → Cohort → 80/20 → RFM → CLV

STEP 8: Generate charts
        Static (Matplotlib) + Interactive (Plotly)

STEP 9: SQL analysis
        60 questions on raw tables in PostgreSQL

STEP 10: Excel reporting
         Pivot tables + slicers on summary data

STEP 11: Power BI dashboard
         Connect all 9 tables, build KPI dashboard

STEP 12: Train ML model
         churn_features → 3 models → best model → save

STEP 13: Deploy
         GitHub + Streamlit + Portfolio page
```

| Matplotlib | Full control over chart styling. Used in every data job |
| Plotly | Interactive charts that business users can explore |
| PostgreSQL | Most common SQL database in data analyst job descriptions |
| Scikit-learn | Simple API, all 3 models use same interface for easy comparison |
| Excel | Business users live in Excel. Shows practical business skill |
| Power BI | Most used BI tool in India. High demand in job market |
| Streamlit | Fastest way to deploy ML model as a web app in Python |
| GitHub | Every employer checks GitHub. Shows code quality and consistency |

## 6. Key Design Decisions

**Decision 1 — Merge all 9 tables into 1 master file**
Why: Easier to run all analysis from one source of truth.
Trade-off: Large file size but manageable for 100K rows.

**Decision 2 — Build 7 separate pipelines**
Why: Each pipeline has one job. Easy to debug, easy to re-run.
Trade-off: More functions to manage.

**Decision 3 — Save summary CSVs as output files**
Why: Portfolio website and Streamlit app can load pre-computed data fast.
Trade-off: Data is static (not real-time).

**Decision 4 — Train 3 ML models and compare**
Why: Shows model selection thinking, not just "I ran one model."
Trade-off: More time to build, but much stronger for resume.

**Decision 5 — Use RFM for customer segmentation**
Why: RFM is the most widely used customer segmentation method in e-commerce.
Trade-off: Simplified CLV (frequency × monetary) not full predictive CLV.
